## More Information

### What is Rust?
Rust is a modern systems programming language that emphasizes performance, safety, and concurrency. It is designed to provide memory safety without requiring a garbage collector, making it an excellent choice for building efficient and reliable software.

Key Features of Rust:
- **Memory Safety**: Eliminates common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows.
- **Ownership Model**: Ensures safety and concurrency through its unique ownership and borrowing system.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for safe concurrency to handle multi-threaded operations effectively.
- **Performance**: Compiles to native code and provides performance similar to C and C++.
