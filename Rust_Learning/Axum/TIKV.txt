Scan with limit:
Using the Scan API, you can scan key-value pairs from TiKV in a range (from a startKey to an endKey).

startKey is inclusive while endKey is exclusive.

To configure the Scan API to return a limited number of key-value pairs, you can use the limit argument.

--------------------------

Scan all data:
The Scan API only returns a limited number of key-value pairs. If you want to fetch all the data in the range from startKey to endKey
