### What is Node js ?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side, outside of a web browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine (the same engine used by Google Chrome) and allows JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, making it a popular choice for building scalable web applications and APIs.
