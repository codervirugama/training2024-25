## More Information

### What is Gherkin?
Gherkin is a **business-readable domain-specific language** (DSL) used to write automated acceptance tests. It follows the **Given-When-Then** structure to define test scenarios and is widely used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Key features:
- Human-readable syntax.
- Supports collaboration between developers, testers, and business analysts.
- Integrates with tools like Cucumber, Behave, or SpecFlow for test automation.


### What is Node js ?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side, outside of a web browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine (the same engine used by Google Chrome) and allows JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, making it a popular choice for building scalable web applications and APIs.
