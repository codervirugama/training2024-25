## More Information

### What is Gherkin?
Gherkin is a **business-readable domain-specific language** (DSL) used to write automated acceptance tests. It follows the **Given-When-Then** structure to define test scenarios and is widely used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Key features:
- Human-readable syntax.
- Supports collaboration between developers, testers, and business analysts.
- Integrates with tools like Cucumber, Behave, or SpecFlow for test automation.
